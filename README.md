Creating my first repository!

Hey!

Just getting started in learning how to program (again!).  It's been a long time!  I've recently started writing macros with VB and I'm taking a Data Science course on Coursera that has a focus on R programming.  I purchased ARCGIS software a year ago and would like to also learn Python to help automate tasks in ARCGIS.  My career has been focused on operations, supply chain and lean/six sigma.  One of my goals is to strenthen my technical skills.

Best,

Nick
